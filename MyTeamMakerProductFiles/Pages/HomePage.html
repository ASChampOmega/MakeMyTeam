        <h2> About Me </h2>
        My Name is Aaryam Sharma. I am a Computer Science Student, about to start the 1A Fall term at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy
        programming greatly. My deepest interests in Computer Science are Algorithm design and Machine Learning (for which I have taken a
        course from Stanford). I also deeply enjoy Pure Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.

        <h2> The Inspiration </h2>
        At the start of EngHack, I did not know anybody. Despite Networking, I was unable to find a team which shared the same interests as 
        I did and also worked towards a product I could contribute towards. Therefore, I saw a need for a product that can help match 
        people on the basis of both, their interests, as well as their skills. Hence, <strong>MyTeamMaker</strong> was born!
