# Files
The uploaded Folder "MyTeamMakerProductFiles" has been uploaded directly after being published from Visual Studio. As I am new to this process of uploading files to GitHub, I am also uploading a separate Zip-file containing only the Images, CSS, HTML and Javascript of the website. Please refer to either as per your convinience. If there are issues opening any files, please write to me at emailaaryam@gmail.com.
